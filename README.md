SYNOPSIS
==================================================================
This demo App provides a way to see the Rotten Tomatoes API in action. 
It is built using Intel's Cross Platform Development Kit (XDK) 
that lets you create mobile apps for smartphones and tablets using
standard web languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).


WHAT DOES THIS APP DO?
==================================================================
Uses Rotten Tomatoes's API to find newly opened movies and top DVD rentals, along with their thumbnail image and rating.


GETTING STARTED
==================================================================
You will need the following to get started -

1. Intel's XDK. Free Download - http://xdk-software.intel.com/
2. A Rotten Tomatoes API key (Register at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/member/register).


OBTAINING THE API KEY
==================================================================
Before you can begin using this app, you will need to get an API key 
from Rotten Tomatoes at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/member/register. This will also 
give you a Single Sign-On Mashery ID with access to hundreds of other APIs.


SETTING UP THE API KEY IN THIS APP
==================================================================
Once you have obtained your API key, assign the API key to the 
variable api_key on line 1 of the file api.js, like so -

```js
  var api_key ='PLACE-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE';
```
